 Holaa!!!(ACCOUNT IN PROGRESS!)

I’m Megha M Sekhar,a first-year Computer Science student at LBSITW who loves building practical tech and exploring startup ideas. I enjoy turning real-world problems into prototypes—whether it’s for coursework, hobby projects, or ideathons.

I’ve built projects like a Blood Report Deviation System (12th boards CS project) and a mood-tracking study planner. I’m especially interested in innovation challenges and entrepreneurship, and I’ve pitched ideas such as Sensora, a real-time accident detection sensor that alerts emergency services, and Maatrika, a government portal for securely maintaining health records of pregnant mothers, newborns, and children up to age 18.

I’ve also conducted beginner-friendly Python sessions for students through a Tinkerhub initiative. I genuinely enjoy helping people—whether that’s clearing doubts, mentoring beginners, or supporting teammates during builds and ideathons.

I’m also a beginner AI generalist—exploring ML/AI concepts, tools, and how to apply them to real products.My current tech stack includes Python, MySQL, basics of C++, and Orange (data mining). I’m always learning, love asking questions, and I’m excited to collaborate on meaningful projects.

PLEASURE TO MEET YA!
